# // My Chezmoi-powered Ultimate 💪 Dotfiles \\\

This repo contains the configuration to have my personally preferred power-user experience \
across any machines you have, using [Chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io), the dotfile manager. \
\> `zsh`, `tmux`, `i3wm`, `polybar`, `neovim`, `gtk3`, `urxvt` < \
\
*This automated setup is currently tested only on Arch-based machines.* \
In case dotfiles will be used by at least several users, I'll consider making it more universal. 🙃

## 💡 Overview 💡

My flavour of `Chezmoi`-driven dotfiles collection, with ❤️:

- [x] Powerful `zsh` config with many useful `zim` modules.
- [x] Ansible bootstrap file `setup.yml` with all the necessary Arch Linux packages, used by me.
- [x] Sane `.gitconfig` with short aliases and many more...
- [x] Some of my preferred fonts in `.local/share/fonts`
- [x] `GTK3` & `GTK2` styling configuration
- [x] Basic, yet big and powerful `.tmux.conf`
- [x] `urxvt` config included (`.Xresources` & some useful tools). Used as a terminal for weak or terminal-based machines.

## 🔧 Simple installation 🔧
